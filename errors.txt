============ ERROR 1 ============
after i have changed my default database from sqlite3 to postgresql
i have successfully dumped the data at this point to a JSON file, 
but when i run py manage.py migrate
i keep getting the error:
...
psycopg2.errors.CannotCoerce: cannot cast type time without time zone to timestamp with time zone
LINE 1: ...ted" TYPE timestamp with time zone USING "created"::timestam...

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
...
django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: cannot cast type time without time zone to timestamp with time zone
LINE 1: ...ted" TYPE timestamp with time zone USING "created"::timestam...

============ SOLUTION TO ERROR 1 ============
Apparently the issue was in my migration file where there were incorrect field 
definitions for the publish, created, and updated fields. They are currently 
defined as TimeField instead of DateTimeField. This is causing the error when 
attempting to cast time without time zone to timestamp with time zone

so i manually replaced the TimeField with DateTimeField

NB:The error happened when i mistakenly run migrations with DateTimeFields defined 
as TimeField in the models.py file

============ ============ ============ ============

============ ERROR 1 ============
After moving to postgresql iam getting the error:
AttributeError at /admin/blog/post/8/change/
'datetime.time' object has no attribute 'date'
on each and every post probably due to TimeField error before
